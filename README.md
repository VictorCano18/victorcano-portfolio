## Víctor Cano Portfolio

This project was made to show a minimalist style fused with my work.<br />
To create the entire structure I used **NextJS** with version **14.0.2.** <br />
Additionally, with the help of **TypeScript** for code logic and **TailwindCSS** for site styling. Last but not least, **Flowbite** to use custom components like Cards or Buttons.
The **Node** version for this project was **18.18.2**

All the code and design was done by me, Víctor Cano.<br />
